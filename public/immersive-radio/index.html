    <p>This plugin integrates radio and radio stations into Helix in a somewhat more immersive way. I also designed declaration of stations and radio items to be as easy as possible while still fitting within the architecture I personally would use.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic radio system with support for multiple different radio items, each with their own frequency bands, interaction sounds, one-way only, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for /Radio, /RadioWhisper, /RadioYell, which change color and eavesdrop radius depending on the command used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated support for languages, where /RadioLang and W/Y variants will be created and allow a language to be passed as a command argument to use to determine what language to radio in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for stationary radio entities that can send/receive messages. Configuration options can be viewed inside of the example entity files provided. Stationary radios can also turn to music/audio file radio stations, described in the following line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Radio stations. You can declare a frequency as a radio station, disabling it from being used as a radio comms frequency. Radio stations can be either a web radio stream or a playlist of local files. Since web streams are pulled live, you just need to specify that the station is a stream and the link to use, and it&rsquo;ll work out of the box. If a local file station, on server start a radio station instance will be created that will select a random starting track; it will then cycle through them all in a row, forever. Tuning into a local file station while a track is playing will jump to the current time of the track as if you&rsquo;ve tuned in live!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrated Extended Radio garbling.</p>

</ul>
