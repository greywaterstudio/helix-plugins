Suppression system with a basic ix.util blur effect and vignette that becomes progressively stronger as more suppression is accrued via bullets or explosions. The amount is tied to the damage that was/would be done, so players will probably suppress you considerably more than NPCs will. I tried to do some math to balance this, but it may be pretty high still." />

    <p>This plugins adds a simple suppression system, where the player&rsquo;s screen will become progressively more blurred as more fire is received.

<h2 id="features-as-of-now">Features as of now</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suppression system with a basic ix.util blur effect and vignette that becomes progressively stronger as more suppression is accrued via bullets or explosions. The amount is tied to the damage that was/would be done, so players will probably suppress you considerably more than NPCs will. I tried to do some math to balance this, but it may be pretty high still.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic suppression fade when the player has gone a few seconds without taking any fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional heartbeat effect that gets progressively faster as the suppression level increases. This requires the sounds in the requiredassets/ directory to be installed on the client to work, so make sure it&rsquo;s in your server content or disable it for performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configurable suppression radius, fade delay time, and if suppression can be accrued inside of vehicles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
