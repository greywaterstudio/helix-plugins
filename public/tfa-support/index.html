This plugin adds support for TFA attachments and weapons as items integrated into Helix in an immersive way, along with a server config-level customization suite to quickly adjust options such as free attachments or visible crosshairs.
Features as of now


Full support for weapon and attachment items.


Attachments that are tied to items will now require and consume an item when put on a weapon, and be returned when removed. They can also require a tool to use, which is defined in the attachment item file as just an item unique ID." />

<h2 id="features-as-of-now">Features as of now</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full support for weapon and attachment items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments that are tied to items will now require and consume an item when put on a weapon, and be returned when removed. They can also require a tool to use, which is defined in the attachment item file as just an item unique ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weapons have their attachments saved as item data, so they can be shared between players and they will persist on server restart. Can also have default set values - see the tfa_weapons sh_example.txt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional restriction that attachments can only be used at weapon workbenches. Compatible with my ARC9 and ArcCW workbenches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional automatic item generation. Don&rsquo;t recommend using it as TFA weapons and attachments do not have descriptions (largely, it&rsquo;s a bit arbitrary for attachments).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, you are allowed to modify and redistribute this plugin however you wish, provided that it is not for commercial use and that I am properly credited for my work. I also accept bug reports - please open an issue on the GitHub repo and I will get to it when I have a chance. This is probably the last weapon base I&rsquo;ll do, as I don&rsquo;t think anyone actually uses MWBase. Right? Right??</p>
