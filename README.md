Note that you can create a `your-name.json` file in `data/authors` to add
personal links and donation addresses if you want more specific credit. If you
do this, for the `author:` line the in the metadata, include the bare file name
of the json file. For example, my file is `data/authors/magetearz.json`, so I
would put `author: magetearz`.
